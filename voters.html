            <h2>VOTING PROCESS</h2><br>
            <p>Voting is a fundamental process in a democratic system. It is a chance for the citizens of a country to
                have a say in the people who represent them or an issue that impacts them. Informed voting and
                participating in elections is one of the responsibilities of citizens of the United States. In the
                United States, the voting process is fairly straightforward. First, an eligible citizen registers to
                vote, studies the candidates and issues, looks up their polling location, then casts their ballot during
                the election.
